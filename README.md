I created this page as part of a class assignment for COMP20 (Web Programming) at Tufts University. It was a really interesting project, and probably took me about 10 hours of work (I'll admit, most of that was looking at prospective background photos and sifting through google fonts). 
I did the assignment by myself, although if w3schools.com were a person they should take the credit for the content, as I pretty much learned everything off that site (with a few small exceptions). 
To the best of my knowledge, this project meets all expectations set for it. I'll likely change a few aspects once it's been graded (I feel narcissistic having my face large and on the landing page- it's going to go in the empty space in my bio).
Feel free to reach out with any feedback!
