        <p>I can give you a scriped blurb about who I am and feature many different adjectives, maybe even throw in some key buzzwords. I can describe to you the person that I hope to be one day, or show you how much I've grown over the past 5 years. I could even put together a corresponding photo collage with just the right number of action photos</p>
        <p>But at my core, I'm curious.</p>
        <p>I like to figure thing out. I want to see how things work and to learn new ideas and skills and to find original ways of expression. And when I find something that I'm passionate about, like computer science or writing poetry or rock climing, I'll follow it and work hard to learn what I can learn and accomplish what I can accomplish</p>
