        <p class="text">    I can give you a scriped blurb about who I am and feature many different adjectives, maybe throw in some key buzzwords. I can describe to you the person that I hope to be one day, or show you how much I've grown over the past 5 years. I could even put together a corresponding photo collage with just the right number of action photos. But that won't give you a sense of who I am, so I'll try my best to tell you.</p>

        <p class ="text">At my core, I'm curious. <br> I like to figure thing out. I want to see how things work and to learn new ideas and skills and to find original ways of expression. And when I find something that I'm passionate about, like computer science, I'll follow it and work hard to learn what I can learn and accomplish what I can accomplish.</p>
